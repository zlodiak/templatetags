===============

A Plugin for django CMS to add CSS classes to other plugins


Installation
------------

This plugin requires `django CMS` 2.4 or higher to be properly installed.

* In your projects `virtualenv`_, run ``pip install djangocms-style``.
* Add ``'djangocms_style'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
* If using Django 1.7 add ``'djangocms_syle': 'djangocms_syle.migrations_django',``
  to ``MIGRATION_MODULES``  (or define ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` if it does not exists);

Usage
-----

You can define styles in your settings.py:

```
CMS_STYLE_NAMES = (
    ('info', _("info")),
    ('new', _("new")),
    ('hint', _("hint")),
)
```

After that you can place other plugins inside this style plugin.
It will create a div with a class that was prior selected around this plugin.
